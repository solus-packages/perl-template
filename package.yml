summary    : Fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system
description: |
    The Template Toolkit is a collection of modules which implement a fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system.
    It was originally designed and remains primarily useful for generating dynamic web content, but it can be used equally well for processing any other kind of text based documents: HTML, XML, POD, PostScript, LaTeX, and so on.

    It can be used as a stand-alone Perl module or embedded within an Apache/mod_perl server for generating highly configurable dynamic web content.  A number of Perl scripts are also provided which can greatly simplify the process of creating and managing static web content and other offline document systems.
